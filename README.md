# Human-Activity-Recognition

This code uses multiple machine learning models (like Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines) to predict human activity recognition using a UCI dataset. It compares the performance of each model, ultimately uses Linear Discriminant Analysis for fitting the training set, and evaluates its accuracy on the test set.
